<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to hold harmless, indemnify, and defend Human from and against any and all claims (including liabilities, fines, damages, losses, costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Platform; (ii) your breach of any term or condition of this Agreement, (iii) your acts or omissions during use of the Services, or (iv) your unauthorized acts or omissions during use of the Services.</p>

<p>You will have the right to defend and compromise such claim at your expense for the benefit of the Human Parties; provided, however, you will not have the right to obligate the Human Parties in any respect in connection with any such settlement without the written consent of the indemnified party; provided, further, Human will have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its expense using counsel of its choice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you fail to assume your obligation to defend or if Human elects to defend such claims itself, the Human Parties may do so to protect their interests and you will reimburse all costs incurred by the Human Parties in connection with such defense.</p>

<h2 id="11-agreement-to-arbitrate-and-prohibition-on-class-actions">11. Agreement to Arbitrate and Prohibition on Class Actions</h2>

<h3 id="choice-of-law">Choice of Law.</h3>

<p>The validity, construction, and effect of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of California, without giving effect to that state’s conflict of laws rules.  Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, the Agreement or the Platform, shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California, in each case located in San Francisco, California, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of this Agreement in your country or county of residence, or any other relevant country or county.   You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.</p>

<h3 id="arbitration-procedure">Arbitration Procedure.</h3>

<p>If you have any issues or dispute with Human you agree to first <a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/contact">contact us</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  All disputes arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement (including formation, performance, breach, enforceability, and validity of this Agreement), our operation of the Services, or a purchase made through the Services shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California or another location if Human consents to such other location, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Human. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<h3 id="waiver-of-class-actions-jury-trials">Waiver of Class Actions; Jury Trials.</h3>

<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. Class actions and class arbitrations are prohibited. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>

<h3 id="limitation-on-claims">Limitation on Claims.</h3>

<p>No action arising under this Agreement may be brought by User more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.</p>

<h3 id="injunctive-relief">Injunctive Relief.</h3>

<p>Without prejudice to the agreement to resolve disputes in binding arbitration set forth in the previous paragraph, either party to this Agreement may obtain preliminary injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, for the purpose of enforcing any of the terms of this Agreement pending a final determination in arbitration or permanent relief for the purpose of enforcing arbitral awards.</p>

<h2 id="12-digital-millennium-copyright-act-procedure">12. Digital Millennium Copyright Act Procedure</h2>

<p>Human respects the intellectual property rights of others and complies with safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Anyone who believes that their work has been reproduced on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement may notify Human’s designated copyright agent in accordance with Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), by providing the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
  <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
  <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</li>
  <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
  <li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
  <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notifications of claimed infringement should be forwarded to Human’s designated agent as follows:</p>

<p>Nicholas C. Zakas, Owner, Human Who Codes LLC</p>

<p>Alternate names the public may be likely to use to search for our designated agent include: Human.</p>

<p>After receiving a valid DMCA notification of claimed infringement, we will process and investigate the claim and will take appropriate actions under the DMCA, including expeditiously removing or disabling access to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. We will take reasonable steps promptly to notify the user who submitted the material that we have removed or disabled access to such material.</p>

<h3 id="counter-notification">Counter-Notification.</h3>

<p>If you posted or submitted material to Human which Human removed or disabled access to pursuant to a DMCA notification of claimed infringement, and you believe your material is not infringing and the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may send a counter-notification containing the following information in writing to Human’ designated agent listed above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
  <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
  <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>
  <li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Human may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the notification of claimed infringement or an agent of such person.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a valid counter-notification is received by our designated agent, we will send a copy of the counter-notification to the original complaining party informing that person that we will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days. Unless our designated agent first receives notice from the original complaining party that such party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringement, we will replace or restore access to the material in 10 to 14 business days after our designated agent’s receipt of the counter-notification, at our sole discretion.</p>

<p>Human reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate accounts for users that are deemed to be repeat copyright infringers.</p>
